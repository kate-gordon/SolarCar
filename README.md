This is our solar powered pygame.

Objective: Build a solar powered car game that, when initialized:

1. Starts a timer
2. Car begins moving to the right
3. User controls vertical movement of the car on the screen
4. Car avoids getting "stuck in traffic".
5. If car gets stuck behind another vehicle, timer is affected.
6. If you pass the finish line, you go on to the next level!

WHERE WE WOULD LIKE TO GO NEXT ... 

Completing step 6: Figuring out timed gameplay & establishment of finish line 
Establish barriers as "Marta" Trains
Cars bound to their own lanes as they randomize 
Background sound & car collision sound
